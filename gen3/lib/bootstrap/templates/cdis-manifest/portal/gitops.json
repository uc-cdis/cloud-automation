(“CVB,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), to the person accessing the Site (“you” or “your”).\nYour access to, and use of, the Site is subject to the BRAIN Commons Terms of Use (the “Terms of Use”). We have created this BRAIN Commons Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) to explain what information we gather when you visit or interact with the Site, how we and others may use your information, and the security approaches we use to protect your information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of the Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.\nBy using the Site, or by signing below, you consent to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated version on this page. Changes to this Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after the date of the change.\nNote Regarding Contributed Data on the Site: The Site is an online platform dataspace or “commons” to facilitate and encourage sharing and analyses of various datasets from research into brain disorders and diseases (collectively, “Data”). CVB strives to foster ethical, authorized and lawful Data sharing and use. CVB is responsible for managing the Site. Users are responsible for their use of the Data and related tools. We prohibit Users and other contributors from posting any raw Data to the Site, unless it is uploaded pursuant to and in accordance with a BRAIN Commons Data Contributor Agreement between us and the contributor of Data. Any such contributed Data must be de-identified in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and such Data must not include any personally identifiable information or other regulated personal information (collectively, “personal information”) of any patients, subjects or participants in the clinical studies through which the Data was generated or gathered. Please review the BRAIN Commons Data Use Policy for more information about contributing, using and sharing Data. We may access or use contributed Data for the purposes of operating, maintaining, monitoring, analyzing, improving, controlling, or customizing the Site, as contemplated by the Terms of Use or our other applicable Policies or agreements. We do not re-identify de-identified information.\n1. What information is gathered?\nWe may collect and retain information from or about you when you register on the Site, seek authentication, send or respond to communications, or participate in another Site feature. Here are the types of personal information we gather:\n    • Information You Give Us: When registering or seeking authentication, or otherwise communicating with us, we may ask you for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credentials or other similar information.\n    • Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us, including IP addresses and session identifiers. Like many websites, we use “cookies” to enhance your experience and gather information about Users and visits to the Site. Please refer to the “Do we use 'cookies'?” section below for information about cookies and how we use them.\n    • Information from Other Sources: For purposes such as authentication, monitoring, completeness or accuracy, we may receive information about you from other sources, including third parties you have authorized to share information with us, and we may add or relate such information to your account.\n    • Contributed Data: As discussed herein, and in the Terms of Use and other applicable Policies, certain contributed Data may be available via the Site. Access to and use of contributed Data is subject to the Zone Rights applicable to such Data and all applicable Policies.\n2. How do we respond to “Do Not Track” signals?\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser- based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies, we do not currently respond to, or provide Users with a different Site experience based on, undefined “DNT” signals to the Site.\n3. How do we use your personal information?\nWe may use your personal information in any of the following ways:\n    • To authenticate or update your information.\n    • To administer your account or profile.\n    • To respond to your support requests or otherwise communicate with you.\n    • To provide or facilitate any services or transactions associated with your account.\n    • To personalize and optimize your Site experience and to learn about your preferences.\n    • To monitor your compliance with the Terms of Use and all applicable Policies.\n    • To prevent or remedy any unauthorized or disruptive activity.\n    • To administer a survey or other Site feature.\n    • To operate, maintain, analyze, improve, control, or customize the Site.\n4. Do we disclose the information we collect?\nExcept as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal information to outside parties unless we provide you with advance notice. We may disclose personal information as described below:\n    • Agents and Contractors: We may contract with other companies and individuals to operate the Site and to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include maintaining and hosting the Site, analyzing data, and providing support. Our agents and contractors have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but they must reasonably safeguard such information and they may not use it or disclose it for other purposes.\n    • Authentication and Monitoring: We may disclose your personal information to third parties as reasonably necessary to authenticate you and your information, as applicable. To facilitate transparency and collaboration, we may use or facilitate monitoring tools that show us and other Users certain information regarding your conduct on the Site, including Data types or analysis tools accessed or contributed. You will have the ability to adjust certain privacy settings with respect to any such tools. Please click here for more information about such monitoring tools.\n    • Business Transfers: In the event that we transfer our assets, or reorganize, merge or transfer our entity, we may provide your information to the purchaser to enable continued use of the Site. We will take reasonable steps to seek similar treatment of your information, but the purchaser might operate under a different privacy policy.\n    • Protection of CVB and Others: We release personal information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply the Terms of Use or our other applicable Policies or agreements; or protect the rights, privacy, property, or safety of CVB, Users or others. We may share information regarding unauthorized or suspicious activity with affected Users, governance board for the BRAIN Commons, an independent Institutional Review Board or other ethics board, or institutional authorities, as applicable. We may assist Data contributors with their review submissions to an ethics or other review board.\nSubject to applicable law, we may share aggregated and statistical information with third parties.\n5. How is personal information corrected or updated?\nYou can correct or update your personal information by re-registering, updating your profile, or by contacting us at hello@braincommons.org. You can also request that we delete your personal information or remove you from our communications.\n6. Do we use “cookies”?\nYes. We use web tracking tools such as cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit those pages, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. We use cookies to track User traffic patterns when you click on various links throughout the Site to help us understand your preferences and to offer better experiences and tools on the Site.\nWe may contract with third party service providers to assist us in better understanding our Users. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve the Site.\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies, through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you might not be able to access or use certain Site services, features or functionality.\n7. How secure is personal information?\nWe follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and properly use your personal information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage in our systems.\nIt is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you are finished using the Site.\n8. Discussion Forums and Third Party Links\nThe Site may include User-to-User communication functionality, such as discussion forums. If you choose to use any of these features, any information you disclose could be accessed and further disclosed by other Users.\nIn an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on the Site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).\n9. Questions and Feedback\nAny questions and feedback about the Site or this Privacy Policy should be directed to hello@braincommons.org.\n10. Important Notices to Non-United States Residents\nIt is important to note that the Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any personal information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the Site and/or providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer.\n11. Children’s Privacy\nThe Site is not directed to, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, children under 13 years of age. If a child has provided us with personal information, a parent or guardian of that child may send an email message to hello@braincommons.org with “Request for Child Information Removal” in the subject line and the name and age of the child in the body of the message. After confirmation, we will make reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from the database that stores information for the Site.",

These BRAIN Commons Terms of Use (these “Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and CVB regarding your access to and use of the technology platform stewarded by the Open Commons Consortium and utilized by the BRAIN Commons, including any website, platform or application, or any embedded or associated services, software, data or content, provided or made available in connection with the BRAIN Commons (collectively, as may be updated, modified or replaced from time to time, the “Platform”).\nPlease read these Terms carefully. By accessing, registering for, or using the Platform, any services provided or made available in connection with the Platform (collectively, “Services”), or any data, software or other materials or content provided or made available on or through the Platform (collectively, “Content” and any such data, “Data”), or by signing below, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to use the Platform, including any Services or Content, in accordance with these Terms. If you are using the Platform on behalf of or in association with an entity, you must comply with such entity’s policies and procedures relevant to your access, registration, or use of the Platform.\nIn addition, when using certain features of the Platform, you also will be subject to the policies, guidelines and terms applicable to such features (collectively, as may be updated from time to time, “Policies”). All Policies, including without limitation the BRAIN Commons Privacy Policy, the BRAIN Commons Data Use Policy, and any additional terms applicable to accessing or using certain Data that are established by the Data contributor and posted on or otherwise made available in connection with the Platform (collectively, “Additional Data Use Terms”), are incorporated by reference into these Terms. If these Terms are inconsistent with any Policy, the terms in the Policy will control to the extent of the inconsistency with respect to the scope of the Policy.\nWe may periodically make changes to these Terms, and we will identify the date of last update. We will post the updated Terms on the Platform, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to post changes in advance if we reasonably determine that such changes are material. We may also, in our discretion, use other commercially reasonable methods to attempt to notify you of such changes. Changes to these Terms will be effective upon posting on the Platform. We encourage you to review the most recent version of these Terms frequently. If you continue to use the Platform after we modify these Terms, you will be deemed to have consented to the updated Terms as of the date of the modification.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth by the BC Manager (or the applicable provider) in writing, all amounts due under or in connection with these Terms shall be paid within 30 days of the date of invoice. The BC Manager (or the applicable provider) shall be entitled to (a) interest on overdue unpaid amounts at the lesser of (i) the rate of 1.5% per month, or (ii) the maximum rate permissible under applicable law; and (b) reimbursement for all reasonable, documented costs of collection of such amounts.\n4. Access to and Use of Data and other Content\n    a.

The Data contributor will set (and may subsequently modify) the Zone Rights for the particular Data, which will fall into one of three categories:\nZone 1 (Public access): Use by any registered user of the Platform (each, a “User”); certain access and functionality may be enhanced once a User has been verified (each, an “Authorized User”).\nZone 2 (Controlled access): Use by Authorized Users after submission of a Zone access request and approval by or through the Data Access Committee (or, as applicable, via another approval process implemented by the BC Manager).\nZone 3 (Exclusive access): Use only by the Data contributor and Authorized Users designated by the Data contributor after (i) submission of a Zone access request and approval by or through the Data Access Committee (or, as applicable, via another approval process implemented by the BC Manager), subject to the Data contributor’s Authorized User designations, and (ii) as applicable, entering into an organizational or dataset specific data use agreement.\n    b. Contribution.\n        You may not post any raw Data or subject-level metadata to the Platform, except pursuant to and in accordance with a separate BRAIN Commons Data Contributor Agreement between you and CVB (if applicable, the “DCA”).\n    c. Disclaimer.\n        We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any data, software or other materials or content (excluding raw Data or subject-level metadata provided pursuant to the DCA) that you post or transmit on or through the Platform, including any modifications or derivatives thereof (collectively, “User Content”), or for any loss, damage, creation, or processing of any User Content. Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor any User Content posted on or transmitted through the Platform, we reserve the right, and have discretion, to remove and screen any User Content posted, stored, or transmitted on or through the Platform at any time and without notice.\n    d. License.\n        If you post or transmit any User Content on or through the Platform, then you hereby grant us and all other Users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such User Content throughout the world in any media.\n    e. Representations and Warranties.\n        If you post or transmit any User Content on or through the Platform, then you represent and warrant that (i) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content that you post or transmit, or you otherwise have the right and authority to post such User Content to the Platform and to grant us and other Users the rights granted under these Terms; (ii) no User Content contains any Restricted Data; and (iii) the use and posting of User Content you supply does not violate the BRAIN Commons Data Use Policy or these Terms, will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity, and will not otherwise create any harm or liability of any type for us or for third parties.\n        For the purposes of these Terms, “Restricted Data” is (1) any information that is regulated by: (A) any applicable national, federal, state or local law, rule, directive or regulation relating to the privacy of personal information, including without limitation the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”); the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 24th October 1995, any subordinate legislation passed under that Directive and any other similar law or regulation; (B) any applicable privacy policy or practice; or (C) any law or regulation concerning the notification to data subjects, law enforcement or other third parties of the occurrence of any actual or suspected disclosure of restricted data or personally identifiable information; (2) any personally identifiable information; or (3) any information or data that is owned by or exclusively licensed to any individual or entity, or in respect of which the use, retention, duplication, or disclosure thereof, is restricted by any individual or entity (including any governmental authority).\n        All Content accessible through the Platform or in connection with the BRAIN Commons is for informational purposes only. Materials are not a substitute for professional advice on any matter, medical or otherwise. Always seek the advice of a qualified health professional. CVB and the BC Manager do not recommend or endorse any treatment, institution, professional, physician, product, procedure, or other information that may be mentioned through the Platform or in connection with the BRAIN Commons.\n5. Confidentiality\n    Without limiting any other applicable obligations or restrictions, you will keep strictly confidential (using at least reasonable care), and not disclose or make available to any third party, any information you obtain or access via, regarding or in connection with the Platform or the BRAIN Commons that is marked as confidential or should reasonably be treated as confidential (excluding information specifically identified by CVB, the BC Manager or the source as non-confidential).\n6.

If a counter-notice is received by the copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party.\n    Our designated agent for notice of copyright infringement can be reached at notice@braincommons.org.\n11. Trademarks\n    Any trademark, logo or other proprietary indicia contained on the Platform are trademarks or registered trademarks of CVB and its licensors, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of the applicable trademark holder.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in these Terms.\n13.

Disclaimer of Warranties\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS, (A) CVB AND THE BC MANAGER HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES RELATED TO THE PLATFORM, THE BRAIN COMMONS, OR ANY SERVICES, DATA OR OTHER CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THEREON OR ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; AND (B) THE PLATFORM AND THE BRAIN COMMONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY RELATED TO ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, QUALITY OR THAT THEY WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.\n    YOU MUST NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF THE BRAIN COMMONS OR ANY OTHER USER REGARDING THE PLATFORM, THE BRAIN COMMONS OR ANY SERVICES, DATA OR OTHER CONTENT THAT YOU OBTAIN ON OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM OR THE BRAIN COMMONS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED BY A USER WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES, DATA OR OTHER CONTENT PROVIDED BY SUCH USER.\n    SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.\n16. Limitations of Liability\n    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER CVB NOR THE BC MANAGER NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR ACCESS OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR ACCESS THE PLATFORM, THE BRAIN COMMONS OR ANY SERVICES OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PLATFORM OR THE BRAIN COMMONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF THE CLAIM AND EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES).\n    TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, THE MAXIMUM TOTAL LIABILITY OF CVB AND THE BC MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLATFORM OR THE BRAIN COMMONS IS $50, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OF THE CLAIM.\n    APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU.

The section headings and titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. You may not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any purported assignment in contravention of the foregoing will be null and void.
