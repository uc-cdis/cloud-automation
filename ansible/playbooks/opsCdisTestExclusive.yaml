# Playbook to add keys for all devops in PlanX on a specific host.
# This particular playbook uses the exclusive flag, which would wipe whatever is not in the file passed 
# 
# @vars:
#   _hosts => hosts in which to apply the playbook
#   _user  => user which you want the authorized_keys file updated. And also as who you are going to SSH in.
#
# EX:
#   ansible-playbook playbooks/opsCdisTestExclusive.yaml -e _hosts=cdistest_admin
