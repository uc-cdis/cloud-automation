# TL;DR

This is the main module that deploys the core of gen3 commons.

Multiple other modules are sub module of this one, including the VPC module, along with squi proxy.


## 1. QuickStart

```
gen3 workon <profile> <commons_name>
```

Ex.
```
$ gen3 workon cdistest test-commons
```

## 3. Overview

Once you workon the workspace, you may want to edit the config.tfvars accordingly.

There are mandatory variables, and there are a few other optionals that are set by default in the variables.tf file, but you could change them accordingly.

Ex.

```bash
# VPC name is also used in DB name, so only alphanumeric characters
vpc_name="generic-commons"
vpc_cidr_block="192.168.144.0/20"

dictionary_url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dictionary-artifacts/datadictionary/develop/schema.json"
portal_app="dev"

aws_cert_name="arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:707767160287:certificate/c676c81c-9546-4e9a-9a72-725dd3912bc8"

# This indexd guid prefix should come from Trevar/ZAC
# indexd_prefix=ENTER_UNIQUE_GUID_PREFIX

hostname="generic-commons.planx-plan.net"
#
# Bucket in bionimbus account hosts user.yaml
# config for all commons:
#   s3://cdis-gen3-users/CONFIG_FOLDER/user.yaml
#
config_folder="dev"

google_client_secret="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
google_client_id="1234567890123455-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"

# Following variables can be randomly generated passwords

hmac_encryption_key="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

gdcapi_secret_key="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# don't use ( ) " ' { } < > @ in password
db_password_fence="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

db_password_gdcapi="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
db_password_sheepdog="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
db_password_peregrine="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
db_password_indexd="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# password for write access to indexd
gdcapi_indexd_password="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

## 5. Outputs

| Name | Description | 
|------|-------------|
| aws_region | Region where resources were deployed |
| vpc_name | Name of the commmons' VPC |
| vpc_cidr_block | CIDR of the VPC |
| fence_rds_id | ID of fence database |

## 6. Consideration

If you want later on deploy EKS using a /22 subnet for the workers private network, set `network_expansion=true` this re-arranges the entire network subnets, so it will destroy the databases to make room for the new subnets.
