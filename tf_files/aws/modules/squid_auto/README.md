# TL;DR
  
This module is intended to bring up a ha-squid environment comprised by at least two instances in an autoscaling group


## 1. QuickStart

This module is intended to be part of the VPC module and not to be called by itself. Nonetheless it could work on its own.

```
gen3 workon <profile> <commons-mane>_squidauto
```

There are mandatory variables, and there are a few other optionals that are set by default in the variables.tf file, but you could change them accordingly.
