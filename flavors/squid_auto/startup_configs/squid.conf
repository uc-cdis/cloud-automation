#give preference to ipv4 address lookups
# This is obsolete in v5
# Instead of obeying dns_v4_first settings, IP family usage order is now primarily controlled by DNS response time: If a DNS AAAA response comes first while Squid is waiting for an IP address, then Squid will use the received IPv6 address(es) first. For previously cached IPs, Squid tries IPv6 addresses first. To control IP address families used by Squid, admins are expected to use firewalls, DNS recursive-resolver configuration, and/or --disable-ipv6. When planning you configuration changes, please keep in mind that the upcoming Happy Eyeballs improvements will favor faster TCP connection establishment, decreasing the impact of DNS resolution timing.

#Because we just use one ACL for the whitelists, there can be
#NO repetitions in the matches.  If there is a wildcard that
#matches an explicit domain, it WILL error and squid will not
#start.
#To test to make sure you don't have an error without restarting
#squid, type 'squid -k check'
